# Smart Stock
### Accessible Supply Chain Intelligence for Small-Scale Restaurants

**Smart Stock** is a lightweight, cloud-native web application designed to democratize supply chain intelligence. We replace manual guesswork with AI-driven precision, providing small restaurants and startups with enterprise-grade predictive analytics and automated sourcing tools at a fraction of the cost.

## About the Project

Smart Stock evolves inventory management from a labor-intensive chore into an AI-assisted strategic asset. By utilizing a **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** model, we eliminate hardware costs and allow restaurant owners to ensure they only buy what they need at the best possible price.

### The Problem
Small-scale restaurants operate on thin margins, often trapped between inefficient paper tracking and expensive enterprise software they cannot afford. This lack of sophisticated tools leads to two critical failures being excessive capital loss being moneyy wasted on food waste and missed revenue from inability to fulfill orders due to missed stock or ingredients.

### Our Solution
Smart Stock solves this by providing accessible supply chain intelligence. Our system analyzes data—such as ingredients, menu items, and sales trends—to predict demand and calculate exactly how much inventory needs to be purchased.
